pathchoosing.py is the main function. It requires the user to input the s and v value of the car, then, it will show all paths predicted and specify the chosen path.

xy2curvtest.py and curv2xytest.py are test functions for transformation between Cartesian coordinates and Curvilinear coordinates. They could be executed as well.

Other files are supporting functions. Curvilinearcoord.py includes transformation function between Cartesian Coordinates and Curvilinear Coordinates. Objects.py contains basic data of obstacles and a basic function to justify whether the path is blocked by obstacles. SplineCurve.py contains basic functions for Spline Curve building both for creating baselines and for predcting paths.

All processes are also gathered together in the file Tracing.ipynb. It could be run via Jupyter Notebook.
